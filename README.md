How to get 100% anonymity on websites?
Select the preferred language
Selecting the preferred language is very important because for example if you speak English you will want to see the sites in English. If your activity is connected to a specific place select the correct English (for example the United Kingdom).

Select the preferred Browser product
For Desktop profiles, you can select Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari. This is the browser that will be visible for the websites, this is derived from the Base Profile. (How does Kameleo work?) The best results can be achieved by Firefox or Chrome.

For no limitation by websites, the latest versions of the browsers are preferred.

The first ten results are always the latest versions of the browser.

Pick a base profile
Pick a base profile that you like.

If you choose, for example, two Firefox 97, win10 from the UK, they wonâ€™t be the same.

Fine-tune the profile settings
By default, the profile settings are set to follow our recommendation.

Time zone, Geolocation, and WebRTC should be left on Automatic settings. This will provide the best values based on the IP address. If you want, you can change them manually. You can read more about it in the Common question's topic.

You can select the launcher for the browser on the Profile Edit page, by clicking the More option under the Browser. The best is Chromium (Chrome profiles will run on Chromium if you select Automatic) and Firefox. See our article for more information: Browser built-in to Kameleo

Our suggestion is to leave it on Automatic and work with Chrome or Firefox profiles.

Set up a proxy to change your IP Address
For the best anonymity, you will have to change your IP address as well. Read this article to understand why a proxy is important. (Why is a proxy important? How to change your IP address?)

Make sure the Base Profile Language and the Proxy's Country match.

We recommend using the Built-in proxy manager. We recommend you use a strong residential proxy with the SOCKS5 protocol. You can find several useful articles about Proxies in our knowledge base.

Most important for the proxy settings:

The proxy country should match the Base Profile Language.
Residential SOCKS5 proxies are the best.
For 2 different profiles, never use the same proxy.
For 1 profile, try to use the same proxy every time. Or at least use proxies from the same region
